Day 14

-Given an array of two integers, I had to find the lowest
common multiple of all numbers in the range between the two
cumbers.

-For example, the array [1,5] should return 60 because the
LCM of 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 is 60.

-I started by creating a function that returns the LCM of
two numbers.

-Then in the other function, I made sure that for the
parameter array, the larger number always follows the
smaller number.

-I set a currentLCM variable to 1.

-Finally, I looped through all the numbers between the
smaller and larger number. For each one, I used the previous
function to find the LCM of currentLCM and i.
