Day 15

CHALLENGE 1

-Given an array and a function, loop through each element and
remove it until you reach an element that the given function
evaluates as true.

-Test if(func(arr[0]) == false)

-Then if it is false, use the shift method and try it again

-If it's true, return the array

-If the array is empty, return an empty array

CHALLENGE 2

-I need to flatten a nested array.

-In the function I make a flatArray variable, then loop through
the passed array

-For each element in the array, if it's an array, concat
flatArray with steamrollArray(arr[i])

-If it's not an array, concat flatArray with arr[i]
