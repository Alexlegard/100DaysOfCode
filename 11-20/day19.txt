Day 19: Kepler's Third Law

-I worked out the mathematical formula for the orbital period,
given the earth's radius, the earth's gravitational constant,
and the object's height. I also rounded to the nearest whole
number.

-I used a for loop to loop through an array of objects, calced
the orbital period, I deleted the old property for the orbital
height and I set a new property for the orbital period.
