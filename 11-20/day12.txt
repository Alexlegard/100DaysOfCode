Day 12

CHALLENGE 1

-I had to make an array containing DNA pairs. This problem
is a little hard to explain.

-DNA is a sequence of letters A, T, C, and G. A and T pair
together, as does C and G.

-For example the string "ATCG" becomes
[["A, T"], ["T, A"], ["C, G"], ["G, C"]]

-First I used the split method to create an array of letters.

-Then I used a switch statement to replace that element with
different things if the letter is A, T, C, or G.

CHALLENGE 2

-Given a letter range that's missing a single letter, find the
missing letter.

-I Created variables for the char codes of the first and last
letters.

-Then I started a for loop with i starting at the charcode of
the first letter, and ending at the charcode of the last letter.

-If the string includes that letter (String.fromCharCode(i))
then return that letter. If no missing letters are found, return
null.
