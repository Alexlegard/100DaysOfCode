Day 16

-I had to translate a string of binary numbers into a sentence

-The numbers correspond to character codes, which can then be
converted into a letter or other character using the fromCharCode
method.

-First I created a helper function to translate a single binary
number into a letter.

-Then I used it in the function that translates an entire binary
string. I used the split method to make an array of binary numbers,
then I looped through the array and used the helper function to
get a character, and I added that character to a results string.
