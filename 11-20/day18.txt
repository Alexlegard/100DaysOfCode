Day 18

-I had to make a person object constructor.

-I assign this.getFirstName, this.getLastName, this.getFullName,
this.setFirstName, this.setLastName, and this.setFullName to
functions.

-I also add a fullName variable (not the same thing as an object
property)

-getFirstName, getLastName, and getFullName take no parameters
and return fullName.split(" ")[0], fullName.split(" ")[1], and
fullName respectively.

-setFirstName, setLastName, and setFullName assigns fullName to

 -name + " " + fullName.split(" ")[1]
 
 -fullName.split(" ")[0] + " " + name
 
 -And name, respectively.
