Day 17

-I had to make a function that sums two arguments.

-If only one argument is provided, return a function
that expects the second argument, and returns the sum.

-If any arguments are not actual numbers, return
undefined.

-My function has a single parameter, x.

-If x is not a number, return undefined.

-If two or more arguments are provided, then test if
the second argument is a number. If it isn't return
undefined and if it is, return x + arguments[1].

-If only one argument is provided, return a function
that takes the second argument y, and returns x + y
(or undefined if y is not a number).
