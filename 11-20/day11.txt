Day 11

-I created a "Search and Replace" function

-It takes an original string, an original word, and a
replacement word.

-Every occurrence of the original word should be replaced
by the replacement word.

-The case of the original word should be preserved. If the
original word is uppercase, the replacement word should be
converted to uppercase. If it's lowercase, the replacement
word should be converted to lowercase.

-Half the problem was solved simply by using the ReplaceAll
method.

-I also added a couple of if statements checking the case
of the first word and I changed the case of the replacement
word accordingly.
