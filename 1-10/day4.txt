Day 4

-I used the filter and map methods to solve a complex problem.

-I had to take an array of numbers, take the positive integers
from the array and return a new array containing the squares of
those positive integers.

-First I used the filter method to filter the array down to
positive integers.

-Then I used the map method to construct a new array containing
the squares of the array created from the filter method.
