Day 1

I created my own version of the Filter method!

-It is my second time creating a function on the prototype of the Array class.

-The first time was two challenges ago, when I recreated the Map method.

-The array being used can be accessed with the 'this' keyword.

-You can use this[i] which is very convenient.

-I created a new array with let newArray = [];

-Then I iterated through 'this'

-For each element in 'this', I invoked the callback method. This calls the
method that was provided to the function whatever it may be.

-Within the loop, I push this[i] to newArray if callback(this[i], i, this)
evaluates to true.

-I returned newArray.
