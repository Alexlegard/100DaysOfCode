Day 5

-I learned how to sort strings alphabetically using the Sort
and localeCompare methods.

-The next challenge was the same thing, but I had to do it
without mutating the original array.

-I chained the concat method and the sort method to an empty
array.

-In the third challenge I learned to split a string into an
array of words using the split method.

-The split method can also be used to split the string into
letters.
