Day 9

CHALLENGE 1

-Given an array of two integers, return the sum of all consecutive
numbers, with the first integer as the lowest and the second integer
as the highest.

-This is just a simple mathematical formula.

CHALLENGE 2

-Given two arrays, return all elements that are in one of the arrays,
but not the other.

-This requires two for loops, one for each of the arrays to check for
elements in that array but not in the other.

-Removing duplicates is not necessary

CHALLENGE 3

-A function is passed an array, then several more elements

-Remove the optional elements from the passed array

-I had to convert the optional elements (using the arguments object)
into an array.

-Then I used the filter method to destroy those elements from the
passed array.
