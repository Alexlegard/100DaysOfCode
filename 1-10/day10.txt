Day 10

-I created an algorithm to convert strings into spinal tap case

-Spinal tap case is lower case separated by dashes. For example:
this-is-alex-legard

-For all occurrences of a lower case character followed by an
upper case character, I inserted a space.

-Then I converted the string to lower case.

-Then I replaced all whitespace characters with a dash. The
replaceAll method takes a regex to be searched with the first
argument, and the new pattern (dash) as the second argument.

-I had to use the regex /[\s_]/m
