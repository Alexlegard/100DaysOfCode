Day 8

-I learned to use the every method for an array to return true
if every element of the array passes a test (the function that's
passed to the every method)

-And also the some method. The some method returns true if at
least one element in the array passes the test.

-Finally I learned currying methods that take multiple parameters.
You can instead make that method take one parameter, and you can
provide the rest of the arguments later.
