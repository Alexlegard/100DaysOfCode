Day 3

Learned Javascript's Reduce method. This was a really difficult challenge.

-Reduce reduces the array down to a single value, which is calculated from
whatever the passed function is.

-There are many ways to use the Reduce method, but the way I did it is to
pass one parameter, which was an arrow function.

-In the challenge, I had to combine Filter, Map, and Reduce to get the
average rating of all Christopher Nolan movies in the array.

-Remember how average is calculated: Sum the ratings of all of Nolan movies,
then divide by the total number of Nolan movies.

-Filter filters the array down to Nolan movies only.

-Then map constructs a new array containing the names of the movies and
their IMDB ratings.

-Then reduce returns a single value: The sum of the ratings of all Nolan
movies.

-Finally, I divided by the number of Nolan movies.
