Day 2

I completed three FreeCodeCamp challenges!

-I learned to use the slice method to return the first three elements
of an array without mutating it.
-I learned to combine two arrays with the concat method without mutating
either of them.
-I learned to use concat to add elements to the end of an array, which
is better for functional programming because it doesn't mutate the
original array.
