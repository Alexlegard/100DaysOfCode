Day 26

Challenge 1: React component with parameters.

-I had passed those parameters in another React component
that used the first component.

-I was reminded that react components could be created as
an arrow function.

Challenge 2: Passing arrays to React components

-Like the first challenge, but arrays have to be treated
as Javascript and I have to put the array in curly brackets.

-To render the array in the original component, I use
props.array.join(", ")
