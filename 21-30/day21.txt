Day 21: Test US Phone Numbers

-I had to test if the passed string looks like a US phone number.

-Of course regular expressions came to mind

-I created an array of regular expressions. Each string in the
array is a regex representing one way that a US phone number could
be arranged.

-Then I used the array.join("|") method to combine all of them into
a single regular expression.

The tricky part was accounting for special characters in strings
and regular expressions, and add escape characters accordingly. The
(, ), and / characters were problematic.
