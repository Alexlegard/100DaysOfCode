Day 30: Use State to toggle an Element

-I had to create a function that toggles a boolean state called visibility
and I had to display a component if visibility equals true.

-I had this function that I found conceptually weird.

toggleVisibility() {
	this.setState(prevState => ({
		visibility: !prevState.visibility
	}));
}
