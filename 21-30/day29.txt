Day 29

Challenge 1: Render state in the user interface

-I simply displayed one of the states in a component.

Challenge 2: Render state in the user interface another way

-I saved the state into a Javascript variable, then displayed the
variable.

Challenge 3: Set state with this.setState

-State in React expects not to be modified directly, rather you
should modify it with the setState method.

Challenge 4: Bind 'this' to a class method

-I found out that in order for methods to have access to state and
props, you need to use this.handleClick = this.handleClick.bind(this)
(in this case for the handleClick method).

-I also read an article on the subtleties of this in both Javascript
and React.
