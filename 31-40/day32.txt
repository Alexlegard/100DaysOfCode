Day 32

Challenge 1: Create a controlled input

-I had a stateful component, with an "input" state and a handleChange
method. I also had an text field.

-I had to make sure the component's state and the value inside the text
field are synced.

-This is easily accomplished by adding the fields
value = {this.state.input} onChange = {this.handleChange}
I need to remember both of these are needed.
