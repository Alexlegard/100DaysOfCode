Day 36

-I completed the next FreecodeCamp challenge: Pass State as Props to Child Components

-It really was a simple challenge, but I had trouble remembering how to pass props
but it's as simple as <Navbar name={this.state.name}>

-I also wrote the entries for the previous two days as I fell quite a bit behind on that
