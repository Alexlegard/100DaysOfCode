Day 35

-Appointment with my mentor Daniel Corner

-He showed me how to use VS code shortcuts, we created a new Footer component,
among other things

-After that, I installed a Font Awesome package to try to incorporate some icons

-Then the terminal warned me that I had some security vulnerabilities

-I managed to screw everything up by running... I can't remember exactly what it
was, but it was something that updated all the packages in package.json to their
newest versions.

-I had to create a new React project and copy over the components folder, then I
had to redo some tasks like deleting reportWebVitals, and reinstalling the React
Router package.

-Then I created some components and added a bit of css so the components are
arranged in a somewhat pleasing way

-This took all afternoon
