Day 37

-Did a FreeCodeCamp challenge where I had to pass the input state as well as
the handleChange method to a component as props.

-I found this one to be a hard one to understand conceptually. I had to ask
chatgpt a couple questions like how does data flow between myApp, getInput,
and renderInput?
