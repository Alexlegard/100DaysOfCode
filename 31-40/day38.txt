Day 38

Challenge 1: Intro to Lifecycle Methods

-I read about lifecycle methods like componentWillMount, componentDidMount,
shouldComponentUpdate, componentDidUpdate, and componentWillUnmount.

-I also read a very confusing article about componentWillUnmount's future
deprecation.

-The challenge itself was very simple, just a single console.log statement.

Challenge 2: use the Lifecycle Method componentDidMount

-I had the componentDidMount pre-written for me to include a setTimeout
statement to change the component's state. This is to simulate an API call.

-All I had to do for this challenge is to display the component's state,
something that I've already done many times.
