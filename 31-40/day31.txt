Day 31: Write a Simple Counter

-I forgot to sumbit the previous day's challenge, so I had to redo it.

-In the constructor I had to bind 3 methods to this: Increment, decrement and reset.

-I declared the methods outside of the constructor

increment() {
    this.setState(prevState => ({
      count: prevState.count+1
    }));
  }
decrement() {
this.setState(prevState => ({
  count: prevState.count-1
}));
}
reset() {
this.setState(prevState => ({
  count: 0
}));
}
